## Resources Needed

### Development Resources
- 1-2 Backend engineers (Rust)
- 1 Frontend developer (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- 1 DevOps engineer (part-time)
- 1 Designer (part-time)

### Hardware Resources
- Development servers: 16GB RAM, 8 cores
- Production servers: 32GB+ RAM, 16+ cores
- Storage: 1TB+ SSD for index
- Network: High bandwidth connection for crawling

### Software/Services
- Domain name and SSL certificates
- CDN for static assets
- Monitoring services
- Analytics platform

## Key Metrics for Success

### Performance Metrics
- Search latency < 200ms for 95% of queries
- Indexing speed > 10 pages/second/thread
- Storage efficiency < 10KB per indexed page
- Crawler throughput > 100,000 pages/day

### Quality Metrics
- Relevance scores matching or exceeding baseline
- Quantum resonance providing measurable improvements over keyword search
- Persistence scoring successfully surfacing evergreen content
- User engagement metrics (CTR, time on site) improving over time

### Scale Metrics
- Index size growing to 10+ million pages
- Supporting 1000+ concurrent users
- Handling 100,000+ queries per day
- Crawler respecting robots.txt for 100% of sites

## Risk Factors & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
- **Database scalability issues**: Start with SQLite for simplicity, plan PostgreSQL migration path
- **Crawler inefficiency**: Implement progressive crawl strategies with priority queues
- **Algorithm computation costs**: Pre-compute vectors and use caching extensively
- **Memory consumption**: Implement compression and streaming processing

### Resource Risks
- **Development time constraints**: Prioritize core features, use iterative approach
- **Infrastructure costs**: Start small, monitor usage, scale as needed
- **Maintenance burden**: Build automation and monitoring from the start

## Timeline Summary

- **Months 1-3**: Core infrastructure, crawler, search quality
- **Month 4**: User interface, deployment, optimization
- **Month 5+**: Advanced features, specialized extensions

## Regular Review Points

- Weekly code reviews
- Bi-weekly algorithm performance assessments
- Monthly relevance quality evaluations
- Quarterly roadmap reviews
