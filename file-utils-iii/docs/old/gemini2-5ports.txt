ok fren, so here's the 4 modules [1entropy.py1, 1prime_hilbert.py`, `tokenizer.py` and ``engine.py`], and `demo.py` as `.txt`s that make up a search engine. this search engine is explained in the `README.txt` and is based on an idea laid out in `search_engine_idea.txt`.



we're gonna port this Python prototype over to Rust following the same modular format, keeping it light and simple. ready to halp me out?




Show thinking
Okay fren, I've got the files you sent over: entropy.txt, prime_hilbert.txt, tokenizer.txt, engine.txt, demo.txt, README.txt, and search_engine_idea.txt. This looks like a really interesting project based on those metaphysical math ideas you mentioned! Porting it to Rust sounds like a fun challenge.   

I'll go through the Python code and the explanation files to understand how it all works, and then we can figure out the best way to translate it into Rust while keeping that light and simple modular format you're after.

Let's start by breaking down what each Python module does based on the code and the README.

tokenizer.py: This takes text and turns it into a list of prime numbers, with each unique word getting a unique prime. It keeps a mapping of words to primes.   
entropy.py: This calculates the Shannon entropy of the list of prime numbers generated by the tokenizer.   
prime_hilbert.py: This takes the list of prime numbers and builds a normalized frequency vector from them. It also has a function for calculating the dot product of two of these vectors, which is used for the "resonance" scoring.   
engine.py: This is the main part that ties it all together. It uses the other modules to process documents, store them, and perform searches. It calculates resonance and entropy difference to come up with a combined score for ranking results.   
demo.py: This is a simple script to show how to use the engine.   
The README.txt  and search_engine_idea.txt  explain the core concepts: mapping words to primes, building vectors, calculating resonance via dot product, and using entropy difference as a factor in the scoring. The idea is to find "conceptual alignment" and "resonance" rather than just keyword matches.   

I'm ready to start planning out the Rust modules. How do you want to proceed, fren? Should we take it module by module and translate the logic?

yeah that would be best - shall we start at `tokenizer.rs` and mover forward module by module please?



Show thinking
Alright fren, let's dive into the Rust port, starting with the tokenizer.

Looking at the Python tokenizer.py:   

It uses re for finding words (\b\w+\b).
It uses sympy.nextprime to get the subsequent prime number.
It maintains two dictionaries: token_to_prime and prime_to_token.   
It has a current_prime that starts at 2.   
The tokenize method processes text, converts to lowercase, finds words, and assigns a new prime if a word is encountered for the first time.   
The print_vocab method iterates and prints the token-prime mapping.   
For the Rust version (tokenizer.rs), we'll need:

A way to handle regular expressions for word splitting. The regex crate is standard for this in Rust.
A way to generate prime numbers. The num-primes crate seems suitable, specifically for finding the next prime.
HashMap from the standard library for the token_to_prime and prime_to_token mappings.
A u64 or similar type for current_prime.
Here is the Rust code for the tokenizer module. I've aimed for a direct translation of the logic while adhering to Rust conventions.

Rust

// src/tokenizer.rs

use regex::Regex;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use num_primes::Generator;

/// A tokenizer that maps words to unique prime numbers.
pub struct PrimeTokenizer {
    token_to_prime: HashMap<String, u64>,
    prime_to_token: HashMap<u64, String>,
    current_prime: u64,
    word_regex: Regex,
}

impl PrimeTokenizer {
    /// Creates a new `PrimeTokenizer`.
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let word_regex = Regex::new(r"\b\w+\b").expect("Failed to create word regex");
        PrimeTokenizer {
            token_to_prime: HashMap::new(),
            prime_to_token: HashMap::new(),
            current_prime: 2, // Start with the first prime
            word_regex,
        }
    }

    /// Tokenizes the input text into a vector of prime numbers.
    pub fn tokenize(&mut self, text: &str) -> Vec<u64> {
        let lower_text = text.to_lowercase();
        let mut primes = Vec::new();

        for mat in self.word_regex.find_iter(&lower_text) {
            let token = mat.as_str().to_string();
            if !self.token_to_prime.contains_key(&token) {
                let next_p = Generator::new().next_prime(self.current_prime);
                self.token_to_prime.insert(token.clone(), next_p);
                self.prime_to_token.insert(next_p, token.clone());
                self.current_prime = next_p;
            }
            primes.push(*self.token_to_prime.get(&token).unwrap());
        }

        primes
    }

    /// Prints the current vocabulary (token to prime mapping).
    pub fn print_vocab(&self) {
        for (token, prime) in &self.token_to_prime {
            println!("{}: {}", token, prime);
        }
    }

    /// Returns the token associated with a prime number, if it exists.
    pub fn get_token(&self, prime: u64) -> Option<&String> {
        self.prime_to_token.get(&prime)
    }

    /// Returns the prime number associated with a token, if it exists.
    pub fn get_prime(&self, token: &str) -> Option<&u64> {
        self.token_to_prime.get(token)
    }
}

// Note: In a real project, you would add tests here.
To use this, you'll need to add regex and num-primes to your Cargo.toml file:

Ini, TOML

[dependencies]
regex = "1"
num-primes = "0.3.0" # Or the latest version
I've also added helper methods get_token and get_prime which might be useful later, although they weren't explicitly in the Python version.

How does this look for the tokenizer module, fren? Ready to move on to entropy.rs?

yis, let's move on to `entropy.rs` now please!



Show thinking
Okay fren, let's move on to entropy.rs.

The Python entropy.py file is quite simple, containing just one function, shannon_entropy, which calculates the Shannon entropy of a list of numbers (in our case, prime numbers).

The logic is:

Check if the input list is empty. If so, return 0 entropy.
Count the occurrences of each unique number in the list.
Calculate the total number of items in the list.
For each unique number, calculate its probability by dividing its count by the total.
Apply the Shannon entropy formula: −∑p 
i
​
 log 
2
​
 (p 
i
​
 ).
For the Rust version (entropy.rs), we'll need:

A way to count frequencies, a HashMap will work well for this.
Access to mathematical functions, specifically log 
2
​
 . Rust's standard f64::log2 is perfect.
The input will be a slice or a vector of u64 (the prime numbers from the tokenizer).
Here is the Rust code for the entropy module:

Rust

// src/entropy.rs

use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::f64; // For log2

/// Calculates the Shannon entropy of a list of u64 values (prime tokens).
/// Shannon entropy measures the average uncertainty of a random variable's possible outcomes.
/// In this context, it measures the diversity/unpredictability of the prime tokens.
pub fn shannon_entropy(primes: &[u64]) -> f64 {
    if primes.is_empty() {
        return 0.0;
    }

    // Count the occurrences of each prime
    let mut counts = HashMap::new();
    for &prime in primes {
        *counts.entry(prime).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }

    let total_count = primes.len() as f64;
    let mut entropy = 0.0;

    // Calculate entropy using the formula: -sum(p * log2(p))
    for &count in counts.values() {
        let p = count as f64 / total_count;
        entropy -= p * f64::log2(p);
    }

    entropy
}

// Note: In a real project, you would add tests here.
This Rust function shannon_entropy takes a slice of u64 values and returns a f64 representing the calculated entropy, mirroring the Python functionality.

Ready to tackle prime_hilbert.rs next, fren?

sure thing fren, on we go to `prime_hilbert.rs` next, please!



Show thinking
Alright fren, let's move on to prime_hilbert.rs.

This module in the Python prototype handles the vector representation of our prime tokens and the calculation of the dot product for resonance.

The Python prime_hilbert.py has two functions:

build_vector(primes):

Takes a list of primes.
Counts the frequency of each prime using a dictionary.
Calculates the L2 norm (magnitude) of the frequency vector.
Normalizes the frequency counts by dividing by the norm.
Returns the normalized frequency vector as a dictionary where keys are primes and values are normalized frequencies.
dot_product(vec1, vec2):

Takes two vectors (dictionaries of prime -> frequency).
Calculates the dot product, handling the fact that the vectors are sparse (only includes primes present in either vector).
For the Rust version (prime_hilbert.rs), we'll represent the vectors using a HashMap<u64, f64>, where the u64 key is the prime number and the f64 value is its normalized frequency.

Here is the Rust code for the prime_hilbert module:

Rust

// src/prime_hilbert.rs

use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
use std::f64; // For sqrt

/// A sparse vector representation where keys are prime numbers (u64)
/// and values are normalized frequencies (f64).
pub type PrimeVector = HashMap<u64, f64>;

/// Takes a slice of prime tokens and builds a normalized frequency vector.
///
/// This function counts the occurrences of each prime, calculates the L2 norm
/// of the frequency counts, and then normalizes the counts by dividing by the norm.
pub fn build_vector(primes: &[u64]) -> PrimeVector {
    if primes.is_empty() {
        return HashMap::new();
    }

    // Count the occurrences of each prime
    let mut counts = HashMap::new();
    for &prime in primes {
        *counts.entry(prime).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }

    // Calculate the L2 norm (magnitude) of the frequency counts
    let norm: f64 = f64::sqrt(counts.values().map(|&c| (c * c) as f64).sum());

    // Normalize the frequency counts
    let mut vector = HashMap::new();
    if norm > 0.0 { // Avoid division by zero if the vector is empty or all counts are zero
        for (&prime, &count) in &counts {
            vector.insert(prime, count as f64 / norm);
        }
    }

    vector
}

/// Calculates the sparse dot product of two prime-based vectors.
///
/// This function iterates over the union of keys from both vectors and
/// sums the product of corresponding values. It efficiently handles
/// sparse vectors where many prime frequencies are zero.
pub fn dot_product(vec1: &PrimeVector, vec2: &PrimeVector) -> f64 {
    // Get the union of keys from both vectors
    let keys1: HashSet<_> = vec1.keys().collect();
    let keys2: HashSet<_> = vec2.keys().collect();
    let all_keys = keys1.union(&keys2);

    // Calculate the dot product
    let mut dot_prod = 0.0;
    for &key in all_keys {
        let val1 = vec1.get(key).unwrap_or(&0.0);
        let val2 = vec2.get(key).unwrap_or(&0.0);
        dot_prod += val1 * val2;
    }

    dot_prod
}

// Note: In a real project, you would add tests here.
We define a PrimeVector type alias for HashMap<u64, f64> to make the function signatures cleaner. The build_vector function calculates frequencies and normalizes, while dot_product efficiently computes the dot product for sparse vectors.

This covers the prime_hilbert module, fren. Ready for the main engine.rs next?

yup, sure thing, all ready to dive into `engine.rs` please fren!



Show thinking
Okay fren, let's dive into the heart of the engine and translate engine.rs. This module brings together the tokenizer, entropy, and prime vector logic to create the searchable index and perform queries.

The Python engine.py defines the ResonantEngine class with the following key parts:

__init__: Initializes the tokenizer and an empty list to store documents.
add_document(title, text): Processes a single document by tokenizing, building a prime vector, calculating entropy, and storing the results along with the original text and title.
load_directory(folder): Reads all .txt files from a specified folder, calls add_document for each, and handles file reading.
search(query, top_k): Processes the query, calculates its vector and entropy, then iterates through the stored documents. For each document, it calculates the resonance (dot product of query vector and document vector) and the absolute difference in entropy. It computes a combined score using the formula resonance - delta_entropy * 0.1 (the 0.1 is a weight), sorts the results by this score, and returns the top top_k results.   
For the Rust version (engine.rs), we'll create a ResonantEngine struct. We'll also need a struct to hold the processed document data and another for the search results. File system operations in Rust return Result types, so we'll need to incorporate error handling, particularly in load_directory.

Here is the Rust code for the engine module:

Rust

// src/engine.rs

use crate::tokenizer::PrimeTokenizer;
use crate::prime_hilbert::{build_vector, dot_product, PrimeVector};
use crate::entropy::shannon_entropy;

use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

struct IndexedDocument {
    title: String,
    text: String,
    vector: PrimeVector,
    entropy: f64,
}

/// Represents a search result with scoring details and a snippet.
pub struct SearchResult {
    pub title: String,
    pub resonance: f64,
    pub delta_entropy: f64,
    pub score: f64,
    pub snippet: String,
}

/// The main search engine struct that manages documents and performs searches.

}

    /// Creates a new `ResonantEngine`.
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        ResonantEngine {
            tokenizer: PrimeTokenizer::new(),

        }
    }

        self.docs.push(IndexedDocument {
            title,
            text,
            vector: vec,
            entropy,
        });
    }

    /// Loads and indexes all .txt files from a directory.
    /// Returns a Result indicating success or an I/O error.
    pub fn load_directory<P: AsRef<Path>>(&mut self, folder: P) -> io::Result<()> {
        for entry in fs::read_dir(folder)? {
            let entry = entry?;
            let path = entry.path();

            if path.is_file() && path.extension().and_then(|s| s.to_str()) == Some("txt") {
                let text = fs::read_to_string(&path)?;
                let title = path.file_stem()
                                .and_then(|s| s.to_str())
                                .unwrap_or("unknown")

            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    /// Performs a search query against the indexed documents.
    /// Returns a vector of `SearchResult`s, sorted by score in descending order.
    pub fn search(&mut self, query: &str, top_k: usize) -> Vec<SearchResult> {

        let query_vec = build_vector(&query_tokens);

        let mut results: Vec<SearchResult> = self.docs.iter().map(|doc| {
            let resonance = dot_product(&query_vec, &doc.vector);
            let delta_entropy = (doc.entropy - query_entropy).abs();
            let score = resonance - delta_entropy * self.entropy_weight; // Score calculation [cite: 7]

            // Generate snippet
            let snippet_text = doc.text.chars().take(200).collect::<String>();
            let snippet = snippet_text.trim().replace('\n', ' ') + "..."; // Snippet logic [cite: 8]


            SearchResult {
                title: doc.title.clone(),

    }

    // Method to set the entropy weight, if needed
    pub fn set_entropy_weight(&mut self, weight: f64) {
        self.entropy_weight = weight;
    }
}

// Note: In a real project, you would add tests here.
This Rust code provides the core ResonantEngine with the add_document, load_directory, and search methods, mirroring the Python implementation. We've included basic error handling for file operations in load_directory.

To use this module, your src/main.rs (or a separate demo.rs if you prefer) would interact with the ResonantEngine struct. You'll also need to make sure your Cargo.toml includes the necessary dependencies (regex, num-primes) and that the modules are declared in src/lib.rs or src/main.rs correctly using mod.

With the engine in place, we just need the demo.rs to show how to use it, fren! Ready for the final piece?

shall we set `demo.py` equivalent as `main.rs` and declare the other 4 modules in it fren, using `mod` as is relevant?



Show thinking
Okay fren, that sounds like a solid plan! We'll make src/main.rs the entry point, similar to demo.py, and use Rust's mod system to bring in the other modules we've created.

Here's the code for src/main.rs, which will initialize the engine, load documents from a data directory, take a query from the user, perform the search, and print the results.

Rust

// src/main.rs

// Declare the modules
mod tokenizer;
mod entropy;
mod prime_hilbert;
mod engine;

use engine::ResonantEngine;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Initializing Resonant Search Engine...");
    let mut engine = ResonantEngine::new();

    println!("Loading documents from 'data/'...");
    // Load documents from the 'data' directory.
    // We use expect() here for simplicity in this demo,
    // but in a real application, you'd want more robust error handling.
    if let Err(e) = engine.load_directory("data") {
        eprintln!("Error loading directory: {}", e);
        // Exit if we can't load documents, as there's nothing to search
        return;
    }
    println!("Documents loaded.");

    println!("\nEnter your resonant query:");

    // Get query from user
    let mut query = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut query)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
    let query = query.trim(); // Remove leading/trailing whitespace

    if query.is_empty() {
        println!("Query is empty. Exiting.");
        return;
    }

    println!("\nSearching for resonant matches...");
    // Perform search (defaulting to top 3 results)
    let results = engine.search(query, 3);

    println!("\nTop Resonant Matches:");
    if results.is_empty() {
        println!("No results found.");
    } else {
        for (idx, r) in results.iter().enumerate() {
            println!("[{}] {}", idx + 1, r.title);
            println!("    Resonance:      {:.4}", r.resonance);
            println!("    Δ Entropy:      {:.4}", r.delta_entropy);
            println!("    Combined Score: {:.4}", r.score);
            println!("    Preview:        {}", r.snippet);
            println!(); // Add an empty line between results for readability
        }
    }
}
To make this work, you'll need to:

Save the tokenizer.rs, entropy.rs, prime_hilbert.rs, and engine.rs files in a src directory within your Rust project.
Save the main.rs file in the same src directory.
Make sure you have a Cargo.toml file in your project root with the necessary dependencies (regex and num-primes) as mentioned earlier.
Create a data directory in your project root and place some .txt files inside it for the engine to index.
Now, when you run cargo run, it should compile your Rust code and execute the main function, giving you a functional resonant search engine!

We've now ported the core Python prototype to Rust, keeping the modular structure. This is looking good, fren! What do you think?
