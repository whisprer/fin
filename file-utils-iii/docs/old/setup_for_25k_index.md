Quick Setup Guide: 25,000-Document Quantum Resonant Search Engine
Hey husklyfren! Here's your simple guide to get your quantum resonant search engine up and crawling 25,000 pages in no time.
1. Project Setup
Step 1: Create your project structure
bashmkdir -p resonant_search/data
cd resonant_search
Step 2: Create the seed URLs file
Save the provided seed_urls.txt to data/seed_urls.txt with 50+ high-quality seed URLs.
Step 3: Update your Cargo.toml
Replace your existing Cargo.toml with the new version I provided that includes all needed dependencies:

Added flate2 for compression
Added rand for randomized delays
Added serde/serde_json for data serialization
Added csv for data export
Added ctrlc for graceful termination

2. Replace Your Source Files
Step 1: Replace the existing files
Update these existing files with the enhanced versions:

src/crawler.rs - Now follows links and includes politeness features
src/engine.rs - Now has checkpointing and compression
src/main.rs - Now has a full 25k crawl setup

Step 2: Add new imports to other modules
Make sure you have the needed imports in your other files. Add these to the top of your source files as needed:
rustuse std::io::{self, Write};
use flate2::write::GzEncoder;
use flate2::read::GzDecoder;
use flate2::Compression;
use rand::Rng;
3. Running Your 25k Crawler
Step 1: Build the project
bashcargo build --release
Step 2: Run it
bashcargo run --release
Step 3: Follow the prompts
When prompted:

Choose y for both quantum and persistence scoring
Choose option 2 (Load URLs from a file)
Enter the path to your seed URLs file: data/seed_urls.txt
Set max pages to 25000
Set max depth to 3 (or higher if you want to follow more links)
Set workers to 10 (adjust based on your internet connection)

Step 4: Let it run
The crawler will now:

Start with your 50+ seed URLs
Follow links to a max depth of 3
Crawl up to 25,000 pages
Save checkpoints every 100 pages
Compress documents to save memory

4. Key Features

Link Following: The crawler now follows links from seed pages, creating a real web crawler
Checkpoint System: Automatically saves progress every 100 pages to data/checkpoints/latest.checkpoint
Document Compression: Compresses document content to save memory
Polite Crawling:

Random delays between requests
Domain rate limiting
User agent identification


CSV Export: Export your index for analysis in other tools
Smart Commands:

Type export to save your index to CSV
Type checkpoint to save a checkpoint
Type compress to compress all documents



5. Performance Tips

Memory: For 25,000 pages, expect to use 1-2GB of RAM
Time: Expect 3-8 hours for a full 25,000 page crawl
Politeness: The crawler is designed to be polite to websites
Resuming: If the crawler crashes, you can resume from the checkpoint

Troubleshooting

Slow Crawling: Increase worker count (up to 20)
Too Many Errors: Some sites block crawlers - just let it continue
Memory Issues: The auto-compression should help, but you can also manually compress by typing compress during search

Enjoy your quantum resonant search engine with 25,000 pages, husklyfren! This implementation combines cutting-edge quantum concepts with practical web crawling techniques!
