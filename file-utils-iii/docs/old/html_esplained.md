I see that your HTML file is actually complete, woflfren! This isn't a partial file - it's the full index.html for your search engine's web interface.
Let me explain what this HTML file contains:

Proper meta tags for charset and viewport

This is a complete, fully-functional HTML file for your search interface. The "partial" designation might have been misleading - there's no additional HTML needed to complete this file.
When combined with the CSS and JavaScript files we've provided, this will create the modern, responsive web interface for your quantum search engine. The form will submit to the /api/search endpoint that we implemented in the web_server.rs file, and the app.js will handle displaying the results returned from your search algorithm.
