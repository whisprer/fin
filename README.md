# fin

**fin** is a home for a set of compact but complete projects that I consider *finished enough* to share with the world.  
Each project is usable as-is, while still leaving room for further exploration or refinement.  

They’re collected together here so they can live in one place as a cohesive bundle.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 `file-utils-i`
A **file utility toolkit** for working with data at a low level:

- Compression / expansion  
- Encryption / decryption  
- Secure shredding (irrecoverable deletion)  

Includes installers, docs, and quick start examples for everyday use.

---

### 🐺 `file-utils-ii` — *ProcWolf*
A **process monitoring watchdog daemon**:  

- Keeps a vigilant eye on running processes  
- Detects anomalies and rogue behavior  
- Can be extended into a lightweight system guardian  

---

### 🔎 `file-utils-iii` — *Riemann Resonance Search*
A **quantum-inspired search engine** based on Riemann resonance ideas:

- Experimental algorithms for resonance-based search  
- Includes older prototypes (resonant search, quantum resonant search, etc.)  
- A step into unconventional computing models  

---

### 📅 `file-utils-iv` — *Mayan Calendar / Realtime Clock*
A **calendar + realtime clock system** using the **Mayan date/time format**:

- Tracks time with absurd precision  
- Produces eccentric, sometimes surreal output  
- A mix of utility and playful experiment  

---

### 🐉 `woflang9`
A **custom programming language** designed from scratch:

- Built to handle awkward, complex, and repetitive high-level math  
- Offers a REPL, runtime, plugin system, SIMD/analog logic experiments  
- Useful as both an IDE-like environment and a playground for symbolic computation  
- Goes far beyond math: extensible, experimental, and expressive

## Philosophy

This repo isn’t about chasing perfection — it’s about capturing projects at a stage where they’re **solid, functional, and shareable**.  
Each one represents a complete artifact, a creative/technical exploration brought to a satisfying point of release.

## License

Each project includes its own license file. See the respective directories for details.

# 🏆 The Hall of Completed Wonders
### *An Archive of Works Fully Baked, Not Half-Baked*

Welcome, weary coder, curious lurker, and fellow traveler in the land of unfinished side projects.  
Here you will find something rare in the modern age of development: repositories that are actually **done**.

Not *“vaguely functioning.”*  
Not *“MVP for now.”*  
Not *“just needs some documentation.”*  

These are the **finished symphonies** of my coding career — every bug squashed, every rough edge sanded smooth, every nitpick addressed until there was nothing left to do but put down the keyboard and whisper:

> *“It is complete.”*

---

## 🎯 What Qualifies for the Hall of Completed Wonders?
To make the cut, a project must:

- **Be truly finished** — no “we’ll get around to that later.”
- **Tie up all loose ends** — even that one obscure edge-case involving a leap year and a lunar eclipse.
- **Have zero known bugs** — yes, even the ones you could only find by accident.
- **Be fully documented** — README polished, instructions foolproof, diagrams clear.
- **Include all nice-to-haves** — icons, logos, extra polish features, and the occasional hidden easter egg.
- **Evoke the deep soul-satisfying click** of mentally filing it under *“Done, forever.”*

## 📚 The Archive
In no particular order — because art doesn’t need ordering.

### **[Project Name 1]**
A short-but-snappy pitch of what it is, why it’s amazing, and why it’s fully done.  
**Technologies:** List a few.  
💎 **Fun fact:** Add a little quirky tidbit here.

### **[Project Name 2]**
Same style. Different project. Think of this as a museum plaque — elegant, concise, and lightly entertaining.

### **[Project Name 3]**
Ditto. Repeat until all the gems are on display.

## 💬 Closing Words
If you’ve ever finished something truly, irreversibly, *permanently* finished — you know the feeling.  
If not, you can live vicariously through these works.

They are my proof that the mythical *“Done”* state exists —  
and that it can be reached without sacrificing quality, style, or sanity  
(*…well, maybe a little sanity*).
