# fin

**fin** is a home for a set of compact but complete projects that I consider *finished enough* to share with the world.  
Each project is usable as-is, while still leaving room for further exploration or refinement.  

They’re collected together here so they can live in one place as a cohesive bundle.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 `file-utils-i`
A **file utility toolkit** for working with data at a low level:

- Compression / expansion

### 🐺 `file-utils-ii` — *ProcWolf*
A **process monitoring watchdog daemon**:  

- Keeps a vigilant eye on running processes  
- Detects anomalies and rogue behavior  
- Can be extended into a lightweight system guardian

### 🔎 `file-utils-iii` — *Riemann Resonance Search*
A **quantum-inspired search engine** based on Riemann resonance ideas:

- Experimental algorithms for resonance-based search  
- Includes older prototypes (resonant search, quantum resonant search, etc.)  
- A step into unconventional computing models  

---

### 📅 `file-utils-iv` — *Mayan Calendar / Realtime Clock*
A **calendar + realtime clock system** using the **Mayan date/time format**:

- Tracks time with absurd precision  
- Produces eccentric, sometimes surreal output  
- A mix of utility and playful experiment  

---

### 🐉 `woflang9`
A **custom programming language** designed from scratch:

- Built to handle awkward, complex, and repetitive high-level math  
- Offers a REPL, runtime, plugin system, SIMD/analog logic experiments  
- Useful as both an IDE-like environment and a playground for symbolic computation  
- Goes far beyond math: extensible, experimental, and expressive

## Philosophy

This repo isn’t about chasing perfection — it’s about capturing projects at a stage where they’re **solid, functional, and shareable**.  
Each one represents a complete artifact, a creative/technical exploration brought to a satisfying point of release.
