# woflang (Unicode Symbolic Stack Language) - C++23

Woflang is a modular, plugin-driven, Unicode-native stack language, inspired by Forth, J, and symbolic math languages.  
It supports dynamic loading of ops/plugins, symbolic computation, units, and even Markov math suggestion AI!

## Features

- Stack-based symbolic interpreter
- Full Unicode/glyph token support
- Windows DLL plugin system (hot-load ops/constants/AI)
- SIMD-accelerated tokenization (optional)
- Modular symbolic, unit, and pattern math (extensible by plugin)
- Built-in REPL, test runner, CLI utilities
- Cross-platform-ready C++23 (Win-first, Linux easy to port)
- Doxygen-friendly codebase
