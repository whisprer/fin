# proc-wolf Advanced Usage Guide

## Advanced Monitoring and Threat Mitigation Techniques

### Deep Dive into Threat Detection Strategies

#### Behavioral Pattern Recognition

proc-wolf goes beyond simple process name matching by implementing sophisticated behavioral analysis. The system continuously monitors process characteristics to identify potential threats:

1. **Resource Utilization Tracking**
   - Monitor CPU and memory consumption patterns
   - Detect unexpected spikes in resource usage
   - Establish baseline behavior for known processes
   - Flag processes consuming unusually high system resources

2. **Network Connection Analysis**
   - Inspect network connections for suspicious endpoints
   - Track connection frequency and data transfer patterns
   - Identify potential command and control (C2) communication
   - Detect connections to known malicious IP ranges or suspicious ports

#### Advanced Signature and Reputation Verification

##### Digital Signature Deep Dive
proc-wolf performs multi-layered digital signature verification:
- Primary certificate authority validation
- Extended validation of publisher reputation
- Cross-referencing with trusted publisher databases
- Detecting potentially spoofed or suspicious signatures

##### Trust Score Calculation
A comprehensive trust scoring system considers:
- Digital signature authenticity
- Process origin location
- Historical behavior
- Resource interaction patterns
- Network communication characteristics

### Resurrection Detection and Prevention

#### Persistent Threat Monitoring

proc-wolf implements an intelligent resurrection tracking mechanism:
- Track process restart attempts
- Log resurrection frequency and method
- Escalate response based on resurrection patterns
- Implement increasingly aggressive mitigation strategies

#### Resurrection Prevention Techniques
- Service disabling
- Executable quarantine
- Registry key removal
- Startup path blockage

### Nuke Mode: Complete Threat Elimination

#### Comprehensive Threat Removal Protocol

When standard removal techniques fail, Nuke Mode provides a comprehensive threat elimination approach:

1. **Process Termination**
   - Forceful termination of all related processes
   - Multiple kill attempts using different methods
   - Prevent process restart through multiple mechanisms

2. **File System Cleanup**
   - Scan and remove files across multiple system locations
     - User profile directories
     - Temporary folders
     - Application data directories
     - Browser extension locations
   - Use multiple deletion strategies
   - Create detailed removal logs

3. **Registry Purge**
   - Comprehensive registry key removal
   - Target multiple registry hives
   - Remove startup and service entries
   - Clean browser-related registry artifacts

4. **Service Elimination**
   - Identify and disable associated Windows services
   - Remove service registry entries
   - Prevent service resurrection

5. **Quarantine Management**
   - Move potentially malicious files to secure quarantine
   - Preserve forensic evidence
   - Allow optional file restoration

### Advanced CLI Usage

#### Targeted Monitoring Techniques

```bash
# Monitor specific process by name
proc-wolf monitor --name suspicious_process.exe

# Assess threat level of a specific process
proc-wolf assess --pid 1234

# Perform comprehensive system scan
proc-wolf list --assess --filter malware
```

### Custom Configuration Strategies

#### Extending Detection Capabilities

Create custom detection rules by modifying configuration files:

```python
# Example custom suspicious pattern
SUSPICIOUS_PATTERNS.extend([
    r'^company_specific_threat_[0-9]+\.exe$',
    r'backdoor_[a-z]{8}\.dll'
])

# Add custom trusted publishers
TRUSTED_PUBLISHERS.update([
    "Your Company, Inc.",
    "Trusted Vendor Ltd."
])
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Resource-Aware Monitoring

Configure proc-wolf to minimize system impact:
- Adjust check intervals
- Set resource consumption thresholds
- Implement adaptive scanning rates

### Integrating with Existing Security Infrastructure

#### External Tool Compatibility

- Export detection logs in standard formats
- Generate comprehensive threat reports
- Provide API hooks for security information and event management (SIEM) systems

### Forensic and Incident Response

#### Detailed Logging and Analysis

- Maintain comprehensive process history database
- Generate forensically sound logs
- Support incident reconstruction and analysis

### Continuous Improvement

#### Machine Learning Integration Roadmap

Future versions will incorporate:
- Adaptive threat detection models
- Community-driven threat intelligence
- Automatic pattern recognition improvements
