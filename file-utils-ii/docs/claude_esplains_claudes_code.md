Edit
I'll fix the syntax error in the code. The issue is around lines 433-438 where there appears to be an incomplete and duplicated code block. Here's how to fix it:

The problem is in the history_cmd function where there's a duplicated and incomplete block of code. Let me fix that section for you:

python
# Look for lines around 430-440 that look like this:
table_rows.append([
    row_dict['id'],
    row_dict['name'],
    row_dict['timestamp'],
    row_dict['artifacts'],_
             row_dict = dict(row)
    ])
table_rows.append([
    row_dict['id'],
    row_dict['name'],
    row_dict['timestamp'],
    row_dict['artifacts_removed'],
    row_dict['registry_keys_removed'],
    'Yes' if row_dict['service_removed'] else 'No',
    'Success' if row_dict['success'] else 'Failed'
])
Replace that with:

python
table_rows.append([
    row_dict['id'],
    row_dict['name'],
    row_dict['timestamp'],
    row_dict['artifacts_removed'],
    row_dict['registry_keys_removed'],
    'Yes' if row_dict['service_removed'] else 'No',
    'Success' if row_dict['success'] else 'Failed'
])
The issue is that there's a duplicated and incomplete version of the table_rows.append block, with a strange _ character and an invalid assignment in the middle of the list construction. The corrected version uses just one complete table_rows.append call with all the necessary fields.

ok, how do you esplain this? planning to go modular but dint?

Edit
The error you're encountering is a classic Python import problem that happens when you try to work with modular code but don't have the proper module installed or available in your Python path. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.

Understanding the Error
The error message ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'proc_wolf' tells us Python cannot find a module named "proc_wolf" that your script is trying to import. The problem is occurring in this part of your code:

python
from proc_wolf import (
    Database, get_process_info, evaluate_threat_level, 
    kill_process, prevent_resurrection, nuke_process,
    THREAT_LEVEL, ACTION_LEVEL, DB_FILE, is_admin
)
What's Happening
Your script proc_wolf_full_3-0.py is designed to work as part of a larger package where there should be a separate proc_wolf.py module (or a directory named proc_wolf with an __init__.py file). The script is trying to import functions and classes from this module, but Python can't find it.

Notice this part in your code:

python
# Ensure we can import from proc-wolf
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
This line attempts to add the current directory to the Python path so it can find the proc_wolf module, but it's still not working. This suggests one of several possibilities:

The proc_wolf.py file doesn't exist in the same directory as your script
The file exists but with a different name
The directory structure isn't what the code expects
How to Fix It
Here are the solutions you can try:

Option 1: Create the missing module
If you want to keep using the modular approach, you need to create the proc_wolf.py file with all the required functions and classes. This would be the proper way to maintain the code architecture.

Option 2: Integrate the code
As a quick fix, you could copy the content of the missing proc_wolf.py file directly into your script, replacing the import statement. This would make the script self-contained but less maintainable.

Option 3: Fix your directory structure
Make sure your script is in the correct directory relative to the proc_wolf.py file. The structure should be:

some_directory/
├── proc_wolf_full_3-0.py
└── proc_wolf.py  (or a proc_wolf directory with __init__.py)
Option 4: Install the module
If proc_wolf is meant to be a proper Python package, you might need to install it:

pip install proc_wolf
Or if it's a local package:

pip install -e /path/to/proc_wolf
What Probably Happened
Based on your comments ("planning to go modular but didn't"), it seems like the code was being refactored to use a modular approach, but the process wasn't completed. The main script was updated to import from a module that either wasn't created yet or wasn't placed in the correct location.

This is a common issue during code refactoring - you modify one part of the codebase but don't complete all the necessary changes across the entire project.

To move forward, you'll need to either create the missing module with all the required components, or modify your script to not depend on external modules it can't access.

prob is fren, i only have these 3 files of code plus a venv requirements i already know is incomplete - and no clue how they relate to eachother, if they are complete/modular/standalone/unfinished/etc. because... you're the one who wrote all the damned code and dint say anything bout it not just being single working complete scripts! fiend!

Edit
I understand your frustration! Let me clarify what's happening with these files and explain how to make them work together.

What You Have: Understanding the File Structure
Looking at your files, you have components of what appears to be a modular Python application for monitoring and managing processes in Windows. Here's what each file represents:

proc_wolf_full_3-0.py (documents 1, 2, 5): This is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the core functionality.
trusted_status.py (document 3): This appears to be the core functionality module that should be renamed to proc_wolf.py - it contains all the functions that the CLI tries to import.
proc_wolf_full_2-0.py (document 4): This seems to be an earlier version of the core functionality with some additional features.
requirements.txt (document 6): Basic dependencies list that's incomplete as you noted.
The Problem: Missing Module Structure
The error you're seeing is because your CLI script (proc_wolf_full_3-0.py) is trying to import functions from a module called proc_wolf, but that module doesn't exist in your environment. The code was designed with a modular approach, but the implementation is incomplete.

Solution: Creating the Proper Structure
To make this work, you need to create the proper module structure. Here's what you should do:

Create the module file: Rename trusted_status.py to proc_wolf.py since it contains all the functions the CLI is trying to import.
Place files in the same directory: Make sure both proc_wolf.py and proc_wolf_full_3-0.py are in the same directory.
Install dependencies: Ensure all required dependencies are installed using:
pip install psutil pywin32 wmi tabulate
(Note: I added 'tabulate' which is used in the CLI but not listed in your requirements.txt)
Explaining the Development Pattern
What likely happened here:

The developer started with a monolithic script (proc_wolf_full_2-0.py).
Then they split it into a core module (trusted_status.py, which should be renamed to proc_wolf.py) and a CLI interface (proc_wolf_full_3-0.py).
But they either forgot to rename the module file or didn't include it in your codebase with the correct name.
This is a common pattern in Python development - starting with a single script and gradually refactoring it into a more modular structure. However, it looks like the process was incomplete when you received the code.

How to Fix the Specific Error
The most direct fix for the ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'proc_wolf' error is:

bash
# In your project directory
cp trusted_status.py proc_wolf.py
pip install tabulate  # Make sure this dependency is installed
python proc_wolf_full_3-0.py  # Should now work
This copies the core functionality file to the name the CLI is expecting, and installs the missing dependency that the CLI uses for displaying tables.

Understanding the Code Functionality
Once you get it working, this application appears to be a comprehensive process monitoring and security tool for Windows that:

Monitors running processes
Evaluates their potential threat level
Allows killing suspicious processes
Can completely remove ("nuke") malicious processes
Maintains a history of process activity
It's designed with a gradual escalation system, from merely monitoring suspicious processes to complete removal of malicious ones based on their evaluated threat level.

Let me know if you need more specific guidance on making these components work together properly!
