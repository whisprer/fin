Perfect woflfren! 🎯 I've created your complete proc-wolf self-extracting installer build pipeline. Here's what you've got:
Complete Build System Overview:
1. Build-ProcWolfArchive.ps1

Validates all source files (ProcWolf.exe, ProcWolfCLI.exe, etc.)
Creates compressed ZIP archive with integrity checking
Generates build manifest with checksums
Full error checking and reporting

2. Build-ProcWolfInstaller.ps1

Takes the ZIP archive and embeds it as Base64 into PowerShell script
Creates self-extracting installer with admin privilege checking
Includes service installation, file permissions, extraction modes
Built-in install.bat integration for service management

3. Convert-ProcWolfToExe.ps1

Uses ps2exe to convert PowerShell script to standalone .exe
Embeds proc-wolf.ico icon automatically
Adds version info, company details, digital signature checking
Generates checksums (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
Creates installation guide

4. Build-ProcWolfComplete.ps1 (Master Script)

Orchestrates entire pipeline from source → final .exe
Environment validation, disk space checking
Step-by-step execution with error handling
Build verification and comprehensive reporting
Supports skip flags for individual steps

Usage Examples:
powershell# Complete build (all steps)
.\Build-ProcWolfComplete.ps1 -Version "3.0.1.0" -Company "RYO Modular"

# Build with custom paths and icon
.\Build-ProcWolfComplete.ps1 -SourceDir ".\proc-wolf-src" -IconPath ".\my-icon.ico" -Force

# Clean build with verbose output
.\Build-ProcWolfComplete.ps1 -CleanFirst -Verbose

# Skip specific steps (if you already have some outputs)
.\Build-ProcWolfComplete.ps1 -SkipArchive -SkipInstaller

# Individual step execution
.\Build-ProcWolfArchive.ps1 -SourceDir "." -Force
.\Build-ProcWolfInstaller.ps1 -ArchivePath ".\dist\proc-wolf-files.zip"
.\Convert-ProcWolfToExe.ps1 -IconPath ".\proc-wolf.ico"
Error Checking & Validation:

✅ File presence validation for all required proc-wolf components
✅ PowerShell version and module dependency checking
✅ Archive integrity verification
✅ Digital signature validation
✅ Disk space and permissions checking
✅ Executable functionality testing
✅ Comprehensive checksum generation

Features Built-In:

🎯 Self-extracting - Complete installer in single .exe
🔐 Admin privileges - Automatic elevation checking
🎨 Custom icon - proc-wolf.ico embedded
📝 Installation guide - Auto-generated with checksums
⚙️ Service management - Built-in install.bat integration
